# The game shell (W4.1)

The app can run a scenario. The window shows the sim's world. This note is the
contract for that split. Building changes after tick 0, figures, and input are
later (W4.2–W4.4).

## Threads

Three kinds of thread, and they do not share a mutable world.

- The **window thread** owns the SDL window, input, and the frame. It never
  calls `World::advance` and never waits for the sim. It reads the latest
  published snapshot and the latest scene, and it draws.
- The **sim thread** owns the `World`. It is the only thread that advances it
  or applies commands. After each turn it publishes an immutable snapshot.
- The **chunk workers** already build chunk pixels from a `const render::Scene`.
  They do not see the `World`. They keep that rule.

Pause stops the sim thread from starting another turn. The window keeps
drawing the last snapshot.

## Cadence

A turn is the original multiplayer turn (`anno::sim::Timing` in
`src/sim/include/anno/sim/clock.hpp`): 10 real milliseconds per step, 10 steps
per turn, 100 real milliseconds per turn. The game milliseconds of one step
come from `multiplayer_step_ms` at 100 percent (10 game ms). The sim thread
runs that turn through `run_turn` (`replay.hpp`), which is the path the net
layer will use.

Wall time decides only **when** a turn starts. It does not change the step
size. If a turn takes longer than 100 ms, the next turn waits until this one
has published; missed time is counted and reported, not replayed as extra
steps. There is no catch-up.

## What the snapshot is

The sim thread publishes a copy the window can read without a lock held
across a frame. The first snapshot carries at least:

- the tick;
- the game time;
- the cost of the last turn, and the p95 of turn costs over the last second
  of turns.

The window title and the frame log show those three. The snapshot is not a
`World`. The render library never receives a `World`, mutable or otherwise,
and it gains no sim types. The bridge that copies sim buildings into render
objects lives in the app.

## Static and dynamic

Terrain and scenery come from the island files. Buildings come from the
`World`.

- Islands are the ones the sim placed: an embedded `INSEL5` island as the
  file has it, and for each link the template `resolve_scenario_links` chose,
  at the link's position. The viewer's stand-in (island number mod count,
  `loader.cpp`, OQ-028) is not used for `--play`.
- The scene's building objects are the world's buildings: type, x, y,
  rotation, and `Building::byte0f` as the height byte. The sim does not keep
  a per-object height for scenery (`walk_cells.cpp`). Scenery height stays
  the byte in the file.
- Terrain and scenery are the file's objects with the building items removed.
  The split uses the same type classification the scenario loader uses.
- At tick 0, an object the sim did not place is listed and explained. It is
  not copied back from the file to fill the gap.

`--view` is unchanged. It still builds a scene once from the file and the
stand-in rule.

## `--play`

`anno1503 --play <file.sze>` builds the type registry with
`load_original_registry`, loads the file with `load_scenario_with_links`, and
creates the `World`. The scene is built from the islands that load placed.
The sim thread then runs turns as above.

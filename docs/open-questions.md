## OQ-001: Trailing bytes after the root chunk in `.scp` files
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / chunk container / islands
- **Question:** What is the data after the end of the root chunk in `.scp` island templates, and is it needed for loading islands?
- **What we know:** All 465 `.scp` files parse with `tools/chunks.py` up to the end of the root chunk; 444 of them carry additional bytes after it (GFA §2–3). Format unknown.
- **How to resolve:** Dump trailing lengths and look for correlation with island size (`Po_064x064_…` file names, `INFO`); check whether the bytes are another chunk sequence with a different header; find the `.scp` loader in `AnnoWelt.dll` (`GetAnnoInselFileData`) in Ghidra. Parser must keep the bytes (`trailing`) for round-trip meanwhile (PLAN M1.1).
- **Update 2026-10-16:** the trailer is always exactly 60 bytes and occurs in exactly the 444 files whose root contains `INSEL5`; the 21 `INSEL4` files have none (P: `anno-dump chunks` over all 465 `.scp`). Reader/writer keep it verbatim (`docs/formats/chunk-container.md`).

## OQ-002: `FigurenHeader.dat` record layout and claimed big-endian first 4 bytes
- **Status:** resolved 2026-10-16 — all little-endian; root `ANNO` → `FIGUREN` → 368 `ENTRY` (8-byte prefix + ordinary chunk records), sprite sets in `HAEUSER`, 36-byte frame headers in `TEXTURES` (width, height, colour table, format, anchor, offset, length), three volume headers at the file end. The "big-endian first 4 bytes" claim does not hold for this build. Spec: `docs/formats/figuren.md`; byte-identical round trip in `figuren_corpus`. Remaining unknowns moved to OQ-023.
- **Area:** formats / figures
- **Question:** What is the exact layout of `FigurenHeader.dat` (ENTRY header, key-value records, per-sprite header), and are the first 4 bytes of a sprite header really big-endian?
- **What we know:** Does not parse with the generic chunk parser; ENTRY contains key-value records (12-byte key + u32) with a differing header, keys include `VERSION2`, `HEAD`, `BEWOHNTYPE`, `ROUTETYPE`, `LOGIC`, `PATH`, `COLORS`, `HAEUSER` (GFA §3, PLAN M1.3). Community: sprite header holds height, width, palette id, tag, midpoint, offset, length; "first 4 bytes big-endian" (CL §3, no primary URL recorded). Amsel spec would cover this but is behind a GitLab login (CL §1).
- **How to resolve:** Hex-inspect the file against the community field list; test both endiannesses for plausibility (offsets/lengths within `Figuren*.dat` sizes); obtain Amsel docs bundle (AnnoZone file 9287); locate the reader in Ghidra.

## OQ-003: RLE format of `Figuren*.dat`
- **Status:** resolved 2026-10-16 — `.tex` row RLE (`skip, count, data`, `0xFE`/`0xFF`) with 1 byte per pixel (`V`, `H`, `AV`), 2 bytes `[z, index]` (`Z`, `AZ`) or none (`BSH_ALPHA` shadows = coverage masks); `A` formats put a 2-bit level in the top bits of the count byte. External palettes per figure type (`COLORS`). All 655,842 distinct frame ranges decode; visual check on mower, sheep, galleon, gondola and shadows. Spec: `docs/formats/figuren.md`. Meaning of `z`, `level`, `H`: OQ-023.
- **Area:** formats / figures / rendering
- **Question:** How is sprite pixel data in `Figuren*.dat` encoded (run types, transparency, row termination, bit depth), and how are shadows (`BSH_ALPHA`) stored?
- **What we know:** 16 files, ~280 MB, raw data without header, indexed by `FigurenHeader.dat` (GFA §2). Hypothesis: 8-bit indexed RLE with transparency runs and external palette, by analogy with 1602 BSH (mdcii, anno16_docs) (PLAN M1.3) — 1602 formats are not proven for 1503 (CL §3). Shadows reportedly greyscale `BSH_ALPHA` (CL §3). `AnnoDisplay.dll` RTTI shows blitters for 555/565, alpha, shadow, Z (GFA §1). A₂X Graphics Decoder (GPLv3) decodes these (CL §1).
- **How to resolve:** Decode a known sprite (e.g. figure id 203 = carrier per AnnoZone) and render it; cross-check with Amsel spec or A₂X decoder output; disassemble `tBrush2Screen…` blitters in `AnnoDisplay.dll`.

## OQ-004: Pixel format of `TEXTURE` chunks and `COLOR`/`COLORS` palettes
- **Status:** resolved 2026-10-16 — 8-bit indexed pixels (`BSH_RGB` row RLE, `TEX_RGB` raw), palettes 256 × `[B, G, R, 0]` in both `.tex` `COLOR` and `Anlagen.dat` `COLORS`; `ACCESS` = `"<source>,<texture id>"` records. Specs: `docs/formats/tex.md`, `docs/formats/palette.md`. The community note "palettes are PCX without header, 4-byte entries" fits: every `COLORS` table names a `Farbtabellen\*.pcx` source. Remaining unknowns moved to OQ-021/OQ-022.
- **Area:** formats / textures / palettes
- **Question:** What pixel format do `TEXTURE` chunks in `.tex` use (indexed vs. 16-bit 555/565 vs. other), what is the layout of `COLOR` (`.tex`) and `COLORS` (`Anlagen.dat`, 440 ENTRY), and what does `ACCESS` in `.inc` contain?
- **What we know:** `.tex`/`.inc` parse fully as chunks (GFA §3). Community: palettes are "PCX" without header, 4-byte entries (CL §3). Renderer has 555/565 blitters (GFA §1). drkohler's GFX Extractor reads `Felder.tex` (32×32 ground tiles) (CL §2, PLAN M1.2).
- **How to resolve:** Inspect `Textures/debug.tex` and `ToolGfx/Felder.tex`; try candidate decodings and export PNG; compare with GFX Extractor output if obtainable.

## OQ-005: Does single-player use the internal client/server split?
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE / architecture
- **Question:** Is the `AnnoGame` server (`CreateAnnoServerInstance`) plus `AnnoFrame` NetClient/NetServer path also used in single-player, i.e. do player actions always travel as messages to a server?
- **What we know:** `AnnoGame.dll` exports `CreateAnnoServerInstance`, imports only KERNEL32; `AnnoFrame.dll` exports NetClient/NetServer and imports WS2_32 (GFA §1). Explicitly flagged as "to be checked" (GFA §1).
- **How to resolve:** Ghidra: call graph from `CreateAnnoNetClientInstance` / `CreateAnnoServerInstance` in a single-player start path (PLAN §7 item 4); map `iAnnoNetClient`/`iAnnoNetServer` vtables (`docs/re/interfaces.md`). If yes, the message catalogue gives the command set for `crates/sim`.

## OQ-006: Simulation tick rate of the original
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE / sim / net
- **Question:** At what fixed rate (if any) does the original simulation advance, and is it decoupled from frame rate?
- **What we know:** PLAN M4 leaves the tick rate "e.g. 10–20 Hz, to be decided from M2 findings". Contemporary reports say <15 fps caused more sync errors (CL §4), suggesting coupling to frame rate — not proven.
- **How to resolve:** Locate the tick/update loop in `AnnoWelt.dll`/`AnnoFrame.dll` (PLAN M2); look for timer calls (`GetTickCount`/`timeGetTime`) and divisors.

## OQ-007: x87 floating point in simulation formulas
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE / sim / determinism
- **Question:** Which simulation formulas (production, growth, taxes, movement, fire) use floating point in the original, and what fixed-point equivalent reproduces them within acceptable tolerance?
- **What we know:** MSVC 6 build uses x87 (80-bit intermediates); x64 uses SSE2, so results may differ (GFA §4). Project rule: no floats in checksummed sim state (CLAUDE.md). PLAN §8: "faithful ≠ bit-identical float".
- **How to resolve:** During M2, flag every x87 instruction sequence in recovered sim functions; write differential fixtures; define tolerance per formula.

## OQ-008: Trailing garbage in 12-byte chunk names
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / chunk container
- **Question:** What do the bytes after the NUL terminator in the 12-byte chunk name contain (uninitialised memory, previous name, meaningful data), and must they be preserved verbatim for a byte-identical round trip?
- **What we know:** Names are NUL-terminated and "the rest can be garbage" (GFA §3, `tools/chunks.py`). Round-trip tests require byte-identical output (CLAUDE.md, PLAN M1.1).
- **How to resolve:** Histogram the post-NUL bytes across the corpus; if not reproducible, store the raw 12 bytes in the parsed chunk and write them back unchanged. Check the writer in the original (`SaveGame` in `AnnoScene.dll`) for how it fills the name buffer.
- **Update 2026-10-16:** 22 of 17,529 name fields have non-zero bytes after the NUL (14 `.tex`, 6 `.zei`, 2 `.inc`; names `TEXTURE`, `ANNO`, `COLOR`, `CHARSET`, `HEAD`, `BODY`); the rest are zero-padded. The writer stores the raw 12 bytes, so round trip no longer depends on the answer (`chunk_corpus` asserts the counts).

## OQ-009: Differences between `ANNO` and `ANNOADDON1` roots
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / scenarios
- **Question:** Beyond gating add-on content, how do `.sze` files with root `ANNOADDON1` (27) differ structurally from root `ANNO` (23) — extra chunks, different versions, different field layouts?
- **What we know:** Root counts per GFA §2; community says the root switches add-on content (CL §3). DatEditor handles "ADDON chunks" in `Anlagen.dat` (CL §1).
- **How to resolve:** Diff the chunk-path histograms (`tools/chunks.py` `walk`) of both groups; compare same-named chunks' sizes.

## OQ-010: Versioned chunk names (`INSEL4`/`INSEL5`, `PROD2`, `MONOPOL2`, `BERGWERK2`, `COMPPROFIL2`, `VERSION2`)
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / scenarios / islands
- **Question:** Do earlier versions (`INSEL4`, and possibly unsuffixed `PROD`, `MONOPOL`, …) occur in the GOG corpus, and how do the layouts differ between versions?
- **What we know:** Both `INSEL4` and `INSEL5` occur (GFA §3). Suffix numbers suggest format evolution the loader must cover (GFA §3, PLAN M1.5). Which older names actually occur is not recorded.
- **How to resolve:** Count every chunk name across the full corpus; for names with multiple versions, compare payload sizes/structure; find version dispatch in the loader (Ghidra).

## OQ-011: Symbols in the `FileGame.dll` debug build
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE
- **Question:** Does `FileGame.dll` (debug build, Jan 2004) contain assert strings, source file names or other symbol information that names functions or structures shared with the release modules?
- **What we know:** PDB path `E:\Sources\Anno1503\AddOn\Projects\FileGame\Debug\FileGame.pdb`; export `CreateFileGame`; 369 KB (GFA §1). The PDB itself is not shipped (not listed in GFA). PLAN M2 lists this as a task.
- **How to resolve:** `strings`/Ghidra pass over `FileGame.dll`; record findings in `docs/re/filegame.md`.

## OQ-012: `Data/Debug.dat` is a Bink file
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / assets
- **Question:** What is `Data/Debug.dat` (a Bink video per its magic), and does the game load it at all?
- **What we know:** Identified as Bink (`BIKi`) (GFA §2). Purpose unknown.
- **How to resolve:** Search for the string `Debug.dat` in all modules (Ghidra/strings); play it with ffmpeg to see content.

## OQ-013: Generic container detection is heuristic
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / chunk container
- **Question:** Is there an explicit rule (known set of container names, flag, version) for which chunks contain sub-chunks, or can a leaf payload accidentally parse as chunks?
- **What we know:** `tools/chunks.py` treats a payload as a container if it parses exactly into ≥1 valid chunks with names matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,11}$`, up to depth 6 (`tools/chunks.py`). This is a heuristic, not evidence of the original's rule.
- **How to resolve:** Build the list of container chunk names from the corpus; check that no leaf name is ever classified as container; confirm against the loader in Ghidra. The Rust parser should then use an explicit container-name table. Until then `anno_formats::chunk` deliberately mirrors the same heuristic (and the depth limit `MAX_DEPTH = 6`) so it agrees with `tools/chunks.py`; example: in `Po_064x064_0008_Eskimo.scp` the 20,459-byte `INSEL5` payload does not parse as a chunk sequence, because it starts with 12 bytes that are not a chunk header (`00 00 00 00 40 00 40 00 00 00 00 00`) followed by `INFO`, `HEIGHT`×4, `GFXID`×4, `GELAENDE`×4, `FRUCHTBAR`, `FLUESSE`… chunks. Hypothesis (unverified): the two `u16` 0x40 are the 64×64 island size from the file name. Container detection therefore needs per-chunk knowledge of such prefixes (M1.5).

## OQ-014: `.tex` vs `.inc` count mismatch
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / textures
- **Question:** Why are there 1,214 `.tex` but only 1,213 `.inc` files — which `.tex` has no `.inc`, and is `.inc` optional?
- **What we know:** Counts per GFA §2–3.
- **How to resolve:** Pair files by stem and list the unpaired one; check how the loader handles a missing `.inc`.

## OQ-015: `Anlagen.dat` ENTRY layout
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / buildings
- **Question:** What is the field layout of the 921 `ANLAGEN` ENTRY records (size, footprint, graphics ids, production fields) in the GOG build?
- **What we know:** Chunk structure parses (GFA §2–3). Community sources: Azukee DatEditor `AnlagenParser.cs` (classes `TAnlage*`, `THaus*`), easy-player-boost `build_mod.py` field offsets (production interval, coverage radius, `VermehrTab`) — the latter targets the History Edition files (`Anlagen.dat/.classic/.addon`) and is untested (CL §1). Original function name `parseAnlageReal` (CL §1).
- **How to resolve:** Retrieve DatEditor from Software Heritage (reference only, no licence); verify each offset against GOG `Anlagen.dat` and `Texte.dat [ANLAGEN]` names; locate `parseAnlageReal` equivalent in Ghidra.

## OQ-016: Encoding and grammar of plain-text data files
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / data
- **Question:** What exact syntax (comments, sections, `Key: value`, `Id` blocks, numeric formats) and character encoding do `Data/*.dat` and `Texte.dat` use?
- **What we know:** Described as INI-like plain text with `[SECTION]` headers and `Key: value` or `id:Text` lines (GFA §2, PLAN M1.5); `BGruppen.dat` uses `Id` blocks (CL §3). Encoding not recorded.
- **How to resolve:** Survey all 12 `Data/*.dat` files plus `Texte.dat`; detect non-ASCII bytes and decide codepage (likely Windows-1252, unverified); write grammar into `docs/formats/data-text.md`.

## OQ-017: Sources of non-determinism in the original (fire spread, mass actions)
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE / sim / net
- **Question:** Why do fire spread and large-scale clearing/planting desync, and how does the original detect an "Async"?
- **What we know:** Player reports (History Edition) of desyncs during fire spread and mass clearing/planting (CL §4); original MP had undetected asyncs, OS-mix desyncs (CL §4); string "Async aufgetreten! …" in `AnnoFrame.dll` (GFA §1).
- **How to resolve:** Ghidra: find the code referencing the Async string and what it compares; inspect fire-spread code for unseeded/global RNG or float use (PLAN M2).

## OQ-018: CompLogic vs. CompLogicClassic selection
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE / AI
- **Question:** When does the game load `CompLogic.dll` vs. `CompLogicClassic.dll`, and how do their behaviours differ?
- **What we know:** Both export `CompCreateInstance`; described as add-on vs. classic variant (GFA §1). Removing them disables AI (Venedig mod, CL §2).
- **How to resolve:** Find the `LoadLibrary` call sites in `AnnoFrame.dll`/`AnnoGame.dll`; diff the two DLLs' function sets.

## OQ-019: Role of `Max_Sound.dll` and `DrvMgt.dll`
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** RE
- **Question:** Does `Max_Sound.dll` use DirectSound via COM, and what does `DrvMgt.dll` (exports Setup/Remove) do?
- **What we know:** Both roles marked "presumably"/"not verified" in GFA §1. `DrvMgt.dll` dated January 2004 like `FileGame.dll`.
- **How to resolve:** Check COM CLSIDs/IIDs referenced in `Max_Sound.dll`; inspect `DrvMgt.dll` exports and strings. Low priority.

## OQ-020: Location and format of original savegames
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / savegame
- **Question:** Where does the GOG 2.0.0.5 build write Spielstände, with which extension, and are they the same chunk container as `.sze` (root `ANNO`/`ANNOADDON1`) with additional live-state chunks?
- **What we know:** `AnnoScene.dll` exports `SaveGame`, `AnnoWelt.dll` exports `RepairSavegame` (`analysis/pe_symbols.json`). No savegame exists in the extracted install.
- **How to resolve:** create saves with the original (PLAN M2.1), run `anno-dump chunks` on them, compare chunk sets with the scenario they started from.

## OQ-021: Unknown fields in `.tex` entries and `TEXTURE/HEAD`
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / textures
- **Question:** What do these fields mean: (a) `HEAD` 0x06 (`u16`, always 8, plausibly bits per pixel); (b) `HEAD` 0x14 (4 bytes, `ff 00 ff 00` = magenta in 5,169 of 5,176 textures, `ff 94 00 00` ×5, `00 00 00 00` ×2, plausibly a transparency key); (c) `HEAD` 0x18/0x1A (two `u16`, often `(width/2, height)` but out of bounds for 1,207 textures, plausibly an anchor point); (d) the `H` in `BSH_RGBH` (one texture, `Textures/debug.tex`); (e) the first `u32` of the 8-byte `COLOR` prefix, 0 except for 10 palettes (ids 32, 73–75, 98 in `ToolGfx/fenster.tex` and `fenster8.tex`) where it is 2.
- **What we know:** all from corpus statistics (P), `crates/formats/tests/tex_corpus.rs`; layout in `crates/formats/src/tex.rs`. Visual check 2026-10-16 (b): transparency comes from RLE skips alone — 299 exported textures (every 8th of `ToolGfx/fenster.tex`, all of `Textures/Felder.tex` and `debug.tex`) contain no opaque `ff00ff` pixel, so decoding does not need the key; its use (e.g. a key for the original's blitter) is still unknown.
- **How to resolve:** render textures and compare with in-game screenshots (anchor, key); find the texture loader in `AnnoDisplay.dll`/`View.dll` in Ghidra.

## OQ-022: Constant fields and special entries in `Anlagen.dat` `COLORS`
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** formats / palettes
- **Question:** (a) What is the `u32` at `ENTRY` 0x000? It is 0 in 439 tables and 4 in one, id 109 `Farbtabellen\Flagge01_01.PCX` ("Flagge" = flag); compare the `.tex` `COLOR` prefix, which is 2 on 10 palettes in `ToolGfx/fenster*.tex` (OQ-021 e). Hypothesis, unverified: a palette-kind marker, e.g. a player-colour remap table for flags. (b) What is the `u16` 0 between each 4-byte tag (`BODY`, `NAME`) and its `u16` length — the high half of a `u32` length, or a separate field? (c) Do palette entry 0 (a grey in ≥ 439 of 440 tables) and entry 1 (magenta `ff00ff` in 287) have a fixed role, e.g. shadow/transparency key? (d) Which records refer to a colour table `id` (`ANLAGEN`, `TEXTURES`, `Figuren*`)?
- **What we know:** layout and counts from all 440 entries (P), `docs/formats/palette.md`, `crates/formats/tests/colors_corpus.rs`. The same tag + `u16` + `u16` record shape may occur in `ANLAGEN` or `TEXTURES`; not yet probed.
- **How to resolve:** probe `ANNO/ANLAGEN/ENTRY` and `ANNO/TEXTURES` for the same record shape and for `u16`/`u32` values in 1…440; find the colour-table loader in Ghidra (strings `BODY`, `NAME`, `Farbtabellen`).
- **Update 2026-10-16 (d) resolved for `ANLAGEN`:** each `ANLAGEN/ENTRY` `COLORS` record is a list of 1–3 `u32` ids of these 440 tables (0 = unused slot), and building frames select `COLORS[frame.palette]` (P, `anlagen_corpus`; `docs/formats/anlagen.md`).
- **Update 2026-10-16 (d):** `FigurenHeader.dat` carries its own colour tables per figure type (same `ENTRY` layout, ids from 0 per entry), and frames select them by per-entry index (`docs/formats/figuren.md`), so figures do not refer to the 440 `Anlagen.dat` tables by id. Whether `ANLAGEN`/`TEXTURES` in `Anlagen.dat` do is still open.

## OQ-023: Unknown records and fields in `FigurenHeader.dat` and frame pixels
- **Status:** open
- **Update 2026-10-16 (static analysis, `docs/re/annodisplay.md`):** (c) `z` = signed 8-bit per-pixel depth offset relative to the sprite depth, smaller = nearer (confirmed); (d) `level` 0/1/2/3 = 25/50/75 % blend / opaque, with brush-dependent exceptions (confirmed); (e) `H` = depth-tested but not depth-writing (flat decal), `V` = writing (confirmed; letter reading likely); `M` = melt blend at equal depth; `W` = every-second-column checkerboard (confirmed; decoder fixed); (f) anchors are signed 16-bit and mark the frame pixel placed on the projected object point (confirmed). Still open: (a), (b), the world point the game passes for an object.
- **Area:** formats / figures / rendering
- **Question:** (a) Contents of the entry records `VERSION2` (24 bytes), `HEAD` (16/20), `LOGIC` (28–44, contains `1.0f`), `SCHUSSPOS`, `OBJECTPOS`, and meaning of the strings `BEWOHNTYPE`, `ROUTETYPE`, `FORSCHTYPE`, `WARE`, `BAUWARE`. (b) The 16-byte sprite-set prefix (259 distinct values, trailing bytes look like uninitialised memory) and the records `BODY2` (44), `ANIM` (24), `SOUND2` (128), `GFXDATA` (84, holds a `.tga` source path). (c) What `z` (first byte of `Z` pixel pairs) encodes — per-pixel depth for occlusion? The sheep's values are nearly all 255. (d) What the 2-bit `level` of `A` formats encodes — 4 alpha steps? In the gondola level 3 dominates (2,195 of 2,322 pixels) and drawing all levels opaque looks right, so 3 is probably opaque; levels 0–2 are unconfirmed. (e) The `H` in `BSH_RGBH` (24 frames; also one `.tex` texture, OQ-021 d). (f) Anchor semantics: `(width/2, height−4)` for walking figures, the waterline for ships, outside the frame for 783 frames — draw origin relative to the tile?
- **What we know:** layout, counts and decodability from the whole corpus (P), `docs/formats/figuren.md`, `crates/formats/tests/figuren_corpus.rs`. `AnnoDisplay.dll` has blitters for alpha, shadow and Z (GFA §1).
- **How to resolve:** Ghidra: the figure loader (strings `HAEUSER`, `GFXDATA`, `BSH_RGBAZ`) and the `tBrush2Screen…` blitters in `AnnoDisplay.dll` for `z`, `level` and anchors; statistics over `ANIM`/`BODY2` against frame counts (e.g. 128 frames = 8 directions × 16 steps?); render scenes in the M1.6 viewer and compare with screenshots.

## OQ-024: What island `GFXID` values refer to, and the other island records
- **Status:** open
- **Update 2026-10-16 (b) partly resolved:** `GELAENDE`/`PROD2`/`FLUESSE` items are placed `Anlagen.dat` objects: `u16 id | rotation << 14`, `u16 state`, `u8 x, u8 y` (block-relative top-left); footprint from `ANLAGEN` `HEAD` bytes 0–1 (`docs/formats/insel.md`, "Placed objects"). Open: `state` (mostly `0x3000`), why 97,041 `GELAENDE` and 485 `PROD2` items are exact duplicates, and the remaining 115 overlapping `PROD2` tiles.
- **Update 2026-10-16 (a) resolved:** `GFXID = texture << 8 | u << 5 | v << 2 | r` — a 32 × 32 cell of a 256 × 256 `Textures/Felder.tex` texture with `r` quarter turns; texture 0 = open water. Evidence: corpus statistics and top-down rendering (`docs/formats/insel.md`, "Ground"). Still open from (a): how open water is drawn (no texture 0 exists in any `.tex`), and texture 205 (36 tiles, absent from `Felder.tex`). The `Anlagen.dat` hypothesis below was a dead end for ground; it still holds for buildings (M1.4).
- **Area:** formats / islands / rendering
- **Question:** (a) What does a `GFXID` tile value (`u16`, 0–52,685) select — which graphic, from which file, with which rotation/variant? This blocks drawing terrain in the M1.6 viewer. (b) Layout of the 6-byte items in `GELAENDE`, `PROD2`, `FLUESSE` and of `INFO` (12 bytes), `BERGWERK2`, `OCCUR`, `ANBAU`, `DISCOVER`, `KONTORID`, `DUERRE`, `LOCKED`, `NAME`, `HIRSCH`, `EVENTINSEL`, `STAEDTE`. (c) `HEIGHT` units (0–208) and `FRUCHTBAR` values (0–10).
- **What we know:** grids and block layout (P), `docs/formats/insel.md`. Rejected for (a), measured over all 1,133 islands on 2026-10-16: `GFXID >> 5` as a `FigurenHeader.dat` id (ids exist, but the figures are civilians, mowers, explosions); `GFXID` as an `Anlagen.dat` `ANLAGEN` id (0.26 M of 6.5 M non-zero tiles) or `GFXID >> 5` as one (2.5 M); `GFXID` inside `[BODY2 u32 0, + frame count)` of an `ANLAGEN` sprite set (1.7 M of 7.5 M; only 159 distinct bases, max end 2,795). Low 5 bits are mostly 0–11. `Anlagen.dat` holds 921 `ANLAGEN` entries (ids 1–3998) with `HAEUSER` sprite sets in the figure layout, and three `TEXTURES` pixel volumes (`u32 group`, `u32 9633`, RLE data), so the terrain graphics are most likely there (M1.4).
- **How to resolve:** decode `Anlagen.dat` `ANLAGEN`/`HEAD`/`BODY2`/`GFXDATA` (M1.4) and look for a field whose ranges cover the `GFXID` values; Ghidra: the island loader (`GetAnnoInselFileData` in `AnnoWelt.dll`) and where `GFXID` is used to pick a sprite.

## OQ-025: Frame rows that run past the frame width
- **Status:** resolved 2026-10-16 — the blitters never consult the frame width; overrunning pixels are drawn to the right of the frame box, clipped only by the viewport (`docs/re/annodisplay.md` §3). `decode_frame_clipped` drops them for fixed-size frame images; see `docs/formats/anlagen.md`.
- **Area:** formats / rendering
- **Question:** 51 distinct `Anlagen.dat` frame ranges (`BSH_RGBAZ` 26, `BSH_RGBZ` 19, `BSH_RGBZM` 6) have rows whose runs end 1–16 pixels beyond the frame `width`, although their row count and end marker are exact. Does the original clip those pixels, draw them past the frame edge (into the next sprite column on screen), or wrap them into the next row?
- **What we know:** grammar and counts (P), `docs/formats/anlagen.md`, `anlagen_corpus`. `figuren::decode_frame_clipped` drops them for now. No figure frame overruns.
- **How to resolve:** Ghidra: the RLE blitters in `AnnoDisplay.dll` (`tBrush2Screen…`), check whether they bound `x` by the frame width; or compare a rendered frame with an in-game screenshot.

## OQ-026: Isometric projection details not yet calibrated
- **Status:** open
- **Update 2026-10-16 (animation):** sea, rivers and surf animate from their `ANIM` records; the original's tick unit, per-object animation phase and the height at which water objects are drawn are not traced (approximations in `docs/render/iso.md`, "Water", "Animation and layers"). Rivers whose channel tiles are open water (texture 0) look tile-blocky because of the open-water fill approximation.
- **Update 2026-10-16 (b, water):** the open sea is drawn as animated sprites of `Anlagen.dat` entry 2801 on a staggered lattice at sea level 32 `HEIGHT` units (`docs/re/annowelt.md`, "Sea surface"); implemented in `iso::draw_water`. Still open: how the per-chunk sea bit is set, what shows under open water (texture 0), the animation tick unit, and surf/river objects (`FLUESSE`). Tile triangles (B–C diagonal) and 6 × 6 ground cells confirmed and implemented; per-corner light formula known, light vector not traced.
- **Update 2026-10-16:** (a) resolved by static analysis — heights per corner, one unit = 0.04 world units ≈ 2.06 px at zoom 0 (`docs/re/annowelt.md`, `docs/render/iso.md`); still open: triangle split and the per-corner light byte. (b) open water and ground textures 1–10 are not in the terrain mesh (`AnnoWelt.dll` `0x1009b920`); their drawing path is not found. (d) shadows = 5/8 brightness, depth-tested, not depth-writing (confirmed); default animation frame still open.
- **Area:** rendering
- **Question:** (a) How `HEIGHT` (0–208) raises the ground: pixels per unit, per-corner heights and slopes. (b) How open water (texture 0) is drawn. (c) Exact draw order for overlapping multi-tile objects and for objects vs. raised ground. (d) Which animation frame is shown at rest, and how shadows (`SHADOW` sets, `BSH_ALPHA`) are blended. (e) Whether the anchor rule holds for every footprint (castle 8 × 8: anchor + half diamond = 621 vs sprite height 616). (f) Draw order between the islands of a scenario (only matters where tall sprites rise into a neighbour's rectangle) and what the original shows between islands.
- **What we know:** tile size, tile placement, ground cell mapping and the anchor rule from sprite measurements and renders (`docs/render/iso.md`). Flat raised tiles with lift 1/2 or 1 px per unit show terraces and gaps, so (a) needs slopes.
- **How to resolve:** screenshots of the original at known camera positions (needs an x86 Windows/Wine host); Ghidra: the terrain and sprite blitters in `AnnoDisplay.dll`/`View.dll`.
